# Paw Play 

This app lets you add your chosen pet to cart so that you can play with them. It'll benefit both parties, the owner of the pet and you. The owner of the pet gets free pet sitting services and even get incentive for letting others play with their pet. While you would get the emotionally healing property of a pet and you don't need to commit to taking care of it full term. It'll decrease the amount of animal abandonment because a lot of people buy puppies under emotional decision but later on found that to be too much to handle. This app would hopefully levitate that issue. This was my original intent of the app.
